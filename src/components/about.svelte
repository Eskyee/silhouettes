	</p>

	<h2>WHAT</h2>

	<p>
		<b>YOUR SITE NAME</b> is a video or live stream website where you can expect to see YOUR CONTENT. <b>YOUR SITE NAME</b>
		is a video platform that uniquely sells tickets and access via NFTs. Upon purchase, viewers will also
		unlock exclusive digital assets along with access to the film. These NFTs will be released in three
		separate tiers:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Tier 1 = First 100 buyers - 3 DIGITAL ASSETS/NFTs</li>
		<li>Tier 2 = Next 1000 buyers - 2 DIGITAL ASSETS/NFTs</li>
		<li>Tier 3 = Everyone else - 1 DIGITAL ASSET/NFT</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		*Please note that all tiers will be priced at the same amount. Tiers will prioritize how early
		you got to the party, not how much you paid to get in.
	</p>

	<h2>WHEN</h2>

	<p><b>YOUR NEW SITE</b> will be released on January 01, 2022.</p>

	<h2>WHERE</h2>

	<p><b>YOUR NEW SITE</b> can be accessed worldwide upon release on example.com</p>

	<h2>WHY</h2>

	<p>
		Consumption and creation of art is booming with the recent NFT craze. While it does a great job
		empowering artists, there is a massive barrier to entry with high costs and fees. Film and TV
		are an art form of the masses, and our goal is to price our content as such. Through
		tokenization, we want to change how content is experienced. This project bridges the gap between
		entertainment and crypto while also taking a step closer to hyperbitcoinization.
	</p>

	<h2>HOW</h2>

	<p>
		A wallet is needed to purchase a token, which represents a movie ticket (aka access) to our
		film. Without a token, access to experience the movie will not be permitted. Tokens can be
		purchased using BTC, BTC Liquid, and Lightning Network.
