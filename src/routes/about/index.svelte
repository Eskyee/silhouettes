  <p>
    SILHOUETTES is a sci-fi feature film that is about astronaut Katherine Barnes, who is
    visited by an extraterrestrial, who takes her on a tour of the universe- past, present,
    and future. It will be the first feature film to be released through this state of the art
    streaming platform called ALBA. This will be the first of many future exclusive films and
    series that will be distributed through this platform. Based on their time of purchase,
    users will also be given tokenized assets and digital goodies along with access to the
    SILHOUETTES. These NFT’s will be released as part of three separate tiers.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tier 1 = First 100 buyers - 3 DIGITAL ASSETS/NFTs</li>
    <li>Tier 2 = Buyer 101 to 1,101 (1000 buyers) - 2 DIGITAL ASSETS/NFTs</li>
    <li>Tier 3 = 1102 user onwards - 1 DIGITAL ASSET/NFT</li>

    <h2>WHEN</h2>

    <p>SILHOUETTES will be released in early August 2021.</p>

    <h2>WHERE</h2>
    <p>
      SILHOUETTES can be accessed worldwide upon release. All you need is a digital wallet.
    </p>
    <h2>WHY</h2>
    <p>
      Consumption and creation of art has been booming with the recent NFT craze. While it
      does a great job empowering artists, it also presents a high barrier to entry with high
      costs and fees. Movies and TV series are an art form for the masses, and our goal is to
      price our content as such. Through tokenization, we want to change how content is
      experienced in the crypto space. It also brings us one step closer to
      hyperbitcoinization. With ALBA, We aim to be the Netflix for the BTC world.
    </p>

    <h2>HOW</h2>

    <p>
      We plan to roll out SILHOUETTES and many other future ventures through our state of the
      art platform - ALBA. You will be buying a token that represents a movie ticket to our
      film. Without a token, you won’t be able to experience the movie. You can buy the ticket
      using BTC, BTC Liquid, Lightning and Litecoin. The token comes with access to digital
      goodies and tokenized assets.
